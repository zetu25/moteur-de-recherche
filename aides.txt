if i summarize what i understand about the information content similarity computation:

We have to compute :

Sim(c1,c2) = max [-log p(c) ]

where c is in the Set of concepts that subsume both c1 and c2.

Moreover
p(c) = freq(c) / N

where

freq(c) = number of times c or a child concept of c appear in all articles sets.

And

N = total number of types observed across all article
N = total number of frequency of all the concepts
